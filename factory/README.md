# Guide factory operations

## Failed Kit diagnostics

When the `Run Kit` workflow step fails, the workflow uploads the validated
`factory-diagnostics.json` file as a repository-access-controlled artifact. The
issue failure comment remains a safe summary that links to the workflow run; it
does not read or inline diagnostics.

Download and inspect a bundle with:

```bash
gh run download RUN_ID \
  --repo speakeasy-api/mcp-setup-docs \
  --name guide-factory-diagnostics-RUN_ID-RUN_ATTEMPT
jq . factory-diagnostics.json
```

Artifacts expire after seven days. They contain no raw transcript or tool
payloads. If validation fails closed, the workflow safely skips the missing
artifact.
