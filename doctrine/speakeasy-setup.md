# Speakeasy setup — canonical file

The single source for every Guide's `speakeasy.md`: the steps a reader
follows in the Speakeasy AI Control Plane after finishing External setup
(`external.md`). This file is doctrine — maintained by a human, read-only
to pipeline agents (constitution I7), changed only per invariant I8.
Technical Research transcludes the skeleton below into each guide's
Research Dossier and records the per-guide values it renders with; the
Writer renders `speakeasy.md` from the Dossier like any other facts.
Consumers may omit this file when Speakeasy setup is already in context
(for example an installed MCP server's detail page showing only
`external.md`).

UI facts below are drawn from the product source
(`speakeasy-api/gram`, `client/dashboard`, branch `main`): add-server and
Manual OAuth / Upstream Headers labels from commit `96f7f73` (observed
2026-07-23); Dynamic Client Registration (DCR) attach-sheet labels from
commit `f1d60da` (observed 2026-07-27). Labels are verbatim code-level
strings; a rendered-UI spot check on first use is still worthwhile. No
role may invent a label this file does not carry.

## Per-guide values (recorded in the Dossier's Speakeasy setup section)

- `<remote URL>` — from `meta.yaml` `remotes`. (The Control Plane
  proxies remote servers over streamable-http; the add form's
  **Transport** field is read-only.) Mark each remote
  `tenanted: true` when the reader must paste a region, instance, or
  org-specific URL rather than a single shared public endpoint. When the
  URL is shared but the guide must still skip the catalog (unreliable
  mapping, multi-endpoint selection), set guide-level
  `speakeasy_add_server: custom-remote` instead of mislabeling remotes
  as tenanted.
- Optional `speakeasy_add_server`: `auto` (default), `catalog`, or
  `custom-remote`.
- The Authentication Option the guide documents, which External-setup
  step produced each credential field, and — for OAuth options — any
  scopes the provider requires. For DCR, also record the **Issuer URL**
  (often the remote origin) when the Control Plane cannot discover it
  from protected-resource metadata alone.
- `<further-reading URL>` — the provider's primary MCP documentation
  page, for the closing pointer.

## Add-server path selection

There are two add-server paths. Pick **exactly one** when the path is
resolved; keep both only when Pulse presence is unresolved **and** no
override applies.

1. **Tenanted** — any `remotes[].tenanted: true` → **Custom remote only**
   (treat as non-registry), even if Pulse lists the provider.
2. Else **`speakeasy_add_server`**:
   - `custom-remote` → Custom remote only
   - `catalog` → catalog only
   - `auto` / omitted → Pulse catalog presence in operator notes:
     - **present** → catalog (3rd-party server) only
     - **absent** → Custom remote only
     - **ambiguous** / **skipped** / no lookup → both bullets + soft
       catalog-presence open question

Do not keep the alternate path or a catalog-presence open question when
the path is resolved (tenanted, `speakeasy_add_server` override, present,
or absent).

## The skeleton (anchors are fixed; carry them verbatim)

Both bullets below are **source material**. Research emits only the
matching imperative path (or both when unresolved). Writer renders what
the Dossier chose — not the conditional "If … is in the catalog" framing
when presence is known.

### Add the server in Speakeasy {#add-server-in-speakeasy}

In the Speakeasy AI Control Plane sidebar, under **Connect**, select
**Sources**, then click **Add Source**.

**Catalog path** (Pulse **present** with `auto`, or
`speakeasy_add_server: catalog`; never when tenanted or
`custom-remote`): choose **3rd-party server**. On the **MCP Catalog**
page, find <Provider> (the search box reads **Search MCP servers...**),
open its entry with **View**, and click **Add**. In the **Add to
Project** dialog, click **Add to Project**.

**Custom remote path** (tenanted, `speakeasy_add_server: custom-remote`,
or Pulse **absent**): choose **Custom remote server**. On the **Add a
custom remote MCP server** page, paste `<remote URL>` into **Remote MCP
server URL** and click **Add server**.

**Dual conditional** (Pulse **ambiguous** / **skipped** only, `auto`,
and not tenanted / not forced) — keep both as bullets:

- If <Provider> is in the catalog: choose **3rd-party server**. On the
  **MCP Catalog** page, find <Provider> (the search box reads
  **Search MCP servers...**), open its entry with **View**, and click
  **Add**. In the **Add to Project** dialog, click **Add to Project**.
- If it is not: choose **Custom remote server**. On the
  **Add a custom remote MCP server** page, paste `<remote URL>` into
  **Remote MCP server URL** and click **Add server**.

Either resolved path (or either dual branch) creates the hosted MCP
server and opens its **Overview** page. When only one path is emitted,
close with: This creates the hosted MCP server and opens its
**Overview** page.

### Connect your credentials {#connect-speakeasy-credentials}

From the server's **Overview**, open **Settings**. The Writer renders
only the variant matching the guide's Authentication Option, names the
guide's actual fields, and cross-links each value to the External-setup
step that produced it (or, for DCR with no External credentials, to the
step that produced the issuer / region URL).

- OAuth with a pre-registered client: under **Authentication**, click
  **Configure Manually** (or **Use Discovered** when offered — the
  Dossier records whether the provider publishes discoverable OAuth
  metadata). In the **Attach Remote Identity Provider** sheet, set
  **Client Type** to **Manual**. The sheet shows the **Redirect URI**
  with a copy button — the callback URL the guide had the reader
  register in External setup (`{{ gram.oauth.callback_url }}`).
  <!-- verify(operator): the template key substitutes this same Redirect URI value -->
  Paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret (optional)** from
  External setup, then click **Attach Identity Provider**. Confirm the
  sheet's **Redirect URI** matches the `{{ gram.oauth.callback_url }}`
  value registered under the provider's redirect/callback field in
  External setup — readers paste that template key directly there; they
  do not visit this sheet mid–External-setup only to copy the URI.
- OAuth with Dynamic Client Registration (DCR): under **Authentication**,
  click **Configure Manually** (or **Use Discovered** when offered — the
  Dossier records whether protected-resource metadata makes discovery
  available without a pasted issuer). In the **Attach Remote Identity
  Provider** sheet, when the issuer is not already known, paste the
  provider **Issuer URL** from External setup (typically the remote MCP
  origin). Keep the auto-derived **Slug** and **Display name (optional)**
  unless the Dossier records a project naming requirement. Under
  **Endpoints**, click **Discover** so authorization, token, and
  registration endpoints fill from the provider's authorization-server
  metadata. Under **Session Client**, keep **Client Type** set to
  **Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)** (the default when a registration
  endpoint is discovered). Keep **Token Endpoint Auth Method** at the
  discovered default unless the Dossier records a required override.
  Leave **Scope (override)** and **Audience (optional)** empty unless
  the Dossier records values to enter. Click **Attach Identity
  Provider**. The Control Plane registers the OAuth client at the
  provider's registration endpoint — there is no **Client ID** or
  **Client Secret** to paste, and readers do not register
  `{{ gram.oauth.callback_url }}` on the provider for this path. When a
  client first needs provider access, complete the provider's on-screen
  browser authorization prompts with the intended account (exact prompt
  labels are provider-specific; do not invent them).
- API key / token: under **Upstream Headers**, click **Add header**,
  enter the **Header name** (for example `Authorization`), leave
  **Value source** as **Static value**, paste the value from External
  setup, check **Secret**, and click **Save**. (Catalog installs may
  collect the same headers earlier, in the **Add to Project** dialog's
  **Upstream headers** section.)

## The closing pointer

The guide's final line — plain prose after the last Speakeasy step in
`speakeasy.md`:

> This guide covers setup only. For anything beyond it — billing, tool
> behavior, limits — see <Provider>'s MCP documentation at
> <further-reading URL>.

Rendered as a normal sentence, not a blockquote; the quote above is
template text.

## Out of scope (operator note)

The server's Settings also carry the hosted **Server URL**, publishing,
and plugin surfaces (the dashboard's readiness checklist runs Server URL
→ Authentication → Source → Included in Plugin). Guides stop after
credentials; extend this file deliberately if distribution steps should
ever join guide scope.
